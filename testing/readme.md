# Testing files

 Assorted scripts, and files generated by them, for the purpose of testing and debugging
 the overlap-copy script. They are primarily being included for reference and ease of 
 transporting, testing can be done however the developer decides.


## Usage

 They are intended to be run from within this directory, pointing at the 'tests' folder,
 however changing this just requires altering the 'path_prefix' variable where applicable.
